## Development Docs Protocol

For each new feature, create a timestamped folder in `development_docs/`:

`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<concise_feature_name>`

At feature start, write:

- `research.md`
- `plan.md`

At feature completion, write:

- `summary.md`

Follow the process documented in `development_docs/README.md`.
